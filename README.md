## Balance Meditation

Balance is a meditation app that was used as my cap stone project for Flatiron School.

The application was bootstrapped with Create-React-App and uses React, Redux, React Router, and Bootstrap/Reactstrap (for some UI elements).

A live version of the application is available on https://balance-fis.herokuapp.com on which you can make an account, use the app to record your meditation practice and, eventually, see graphs/data of your meditation consistency.

The application is MIT licensed and anyone is free to use and update. All pull requests and issues are readily considered!
