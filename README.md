## Balance Meditation

Balance is a meditation app that was used as a capstone project for Flatiron School.

The application was originally bootstrapped with Create-React-App and uses React with Hooks, Redux, React Router, Firebase for Authentication, Hasura/Graphql with Postgres for meditation sessions, and MaterialUI (for some UI elements).

Today, it's kind of a project that I use to implement new features of React and its ecosystem, as they develop, and is therefore a constant work-in-progress.

A live version of the application is available on https://balance-fis.herokuapp.com on which you can make an account, use the app to record your meditation practice and, eventually, see graphs/data of your meditation consistency.

The application is MIT licensed and anyone is free to use and update. All pull requests and issues are readily considered!
